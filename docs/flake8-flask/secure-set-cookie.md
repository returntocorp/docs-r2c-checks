# r2c-flask-secure-set-cookie

**tl;dr**: This check follows [Internet cookie best practices](https://techblog.topdesk.com/security/cookie-security/) to help you keep your Flask applicationâ€™s cookies safe by ensuring they are only sent over HTTPS, unreadable by scripts, and by not blindly sending cookies to anyone who asks. This check alerts when the `secure`, `httponly`, and `samesite` keyword arguments are not supplied to `response.set_cookie`.

## Description

Modern web browsers support some great features for keeping web cookies secure. Lots of things can go wrong with cookies:  they can be sniffed in transit, scanned by a rogue script, or slurped up by mischevious domains.

Three of these settings [recommended by Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/security/#set-cookie-options) are:

* `secure` - only allows cookies to be transmitted over HTTPS
* `httponly` - prevents scripts from reading cookies
* `samesite` - blocks cookies from being sent with cross-site requests

Under the hood, web servers send HTTP headers to the browser instructing it how to handle cookies. Flask supports setting these headers conveniently through the keyword arguments `secure`, `httponly`, and `samesite` on `response.set_cookie`.

This check encourages using these security features by alerting on calls to `response.set_cookie` without all three keyword arguments. However, the check does not enforce the settings to be "on." In doing so, the check forces a developer to be explicit about their security settings while allotting for situations where the settings need to be disabled.

This check will alert on these cases, for example:

``` python
from flask import make_response
@app.route("/none_set")
def none_set():
    response = make_response()
    response.set_cookie("cookie_name", "cookie_value")
    return response

@app.route("/some_set")
def some_set():
    r = make_response()
    
    # some values are set but not others
    r.set_cookie("cookie1", "cookie_value", secure=True)
    r.set_cookie("cookie2", "cookie_value", httponly=True)
    r.set_cookie("cookie3", "cookie_value", samesite='Lax')
    r.set_cookie("cookie4", "cookie_value", secure=True, httponly=True)
    r.set_cookie("cookie5", "cookie_value", httponly=True, samesite='Lax')
    return r
```

This check will _not_ alert on these cases:

``` python
import flask
@app.route("/")
def index():
    response = flask.make_response()
    response.set_cookie("cookie1", "cookie_value", secure=True, httponly=True, samesite='Lax')
    response.set_cookie("cookie2", "cookie_value", secure=True, httponly=True, samesite='Strict')
    response.set_cookie("cookie3", "cookie_value", secure=False, httponly=False, samesite=None)
    return response
```
